# Miscellaneous Programing Exercises
This repo contains a number of my programing exercises that someone might find useful to reuse.

## OpenCL/JOCL implementation of Finite State Automata (JoclFsaSearch)
This project contains an implementation of Finite State Automata for pattern searching in OpenCL.

The purpose of the exercise was to compare the performance of running on the CPU with running on the GPU to try to understand/quantify the performance overhead of tasking the GPU.


## Arduino Christmas Lights (ChristmasLights)
This project contains simple Arduino programs that drive my 7 Chistmas lights.  I will upload details of the hardware setup at some point.


## Phone Home Monitor
Monitors a NIC in promiscuous mode to identify if something is "Phoning Phone" to check for updates etc.
