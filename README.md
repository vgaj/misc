# Miscellaneous Programing Exercises
This repo contains a number of programing exercises that I have done that I think are worth sharing as someone might find something useful to reuse.

## JoclFsaSearch
This project contains an implementation of Finite State Automata for pattern searching in OpenCL.

The purpose of the exercise was to compare the performance of running on the CPU with running on the GPU to try to understand/quantify the performance overhead of tasking the GPU.
